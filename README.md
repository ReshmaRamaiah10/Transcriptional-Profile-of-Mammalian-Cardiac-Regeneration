# Repository Contents

## DataCurator
### `curator` folder
- ``run_extract.qsub`` - extracts the SRA file into FASTQ file
- ``run_qc.qsub`` - processes FASTQ files and extracts quality measures

## Programmer
### `Programmer/part_4` - creates BAM format file with reads and alignments from TopHat  
**TopHat alignment with samtools**
#### ``qsub_RK_real.qsub``
- generates ``accepted_hits.bam file``

**Outputs different quality control metrics from the following**
- ``qsub_bam_stat_RK_real2.qsub``  
- ``qsub_geneBody_RK_real_retry.qsub`` 
- ``qsub_inner_dist_RK_real.qsub``

**R scripts generated by RseQC utilities**
- ``RK_cov_real_retry.geneBodyCoverage.r``  
- ``inner_dist_RK_real.inner_distance_plot.r``

### `Programmer/part_5` - Cufflinks with cuffdiff

#### ``run_cuffdiff_RK_real.qsub``
- counts how reads map to a genomic region by annotation  
- generates genes.fpkm_tracking_RK
  
#### ``run_cufflinks_real.qsub``
- identifies differentially expressed genes  
- generates gene_exp.diff
  
#### ``diff_exp_analysis.R``
- filters ``genes.fpkm_tracking_RK`` results for FPKM > 1000

#### ``fpkm_analysis_R_final.R``  
- analysis of gene_exp.diff results

## Analyst
### `Analyst` folder
#### ``diff-exp-gene-identification.R``  
- using ``gene_exp.diff`` to produce a table of top 10 upregulated and downregulated genes
- produces histogram of log2foldchange of all genes and of significant genes  
- generates two files, one for upregulated genes, other for downregulated genes
  
## Biologist
### `Biologist` folder
#### ``Project_2_Biologist.R``  
- using ``genes.fpkm_tracking`` generates line plots to replicate Figure 1D in paper  
- using the file for up- and down-regulated genes from DAVID, show overlap with those in paper from Supplemental data  
- creates a heatmap of top 1000 DE genes from FKPM matrix of all FPKM values for each sample
- Generates images for Figures 10 + 11 and Tables 4 + 5 in report
